This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can access a live version of the app [here](https://fispe.github.io/react-weather-app/).

## Weather App

Web application to retrieve the actual weather and the forecast of an specified city.

This is the first project done by myself based on React.
To gain familiarity with older versions of React, it was done using classes, avoiding newest functionalities like hooks.
It uses OpenWeather API to obtain the data.
